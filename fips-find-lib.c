/* The purpose of this program is to locate the libEGL or libGL which would
 * ordinarily be found by fips's target application.  It checks the sole
 * parameter and dynamically loads libEGL or libGL.  The file name of the lib
 * that was loaded is printed.
 *
 * We need to use an external program for this purpose to handle the case where
 * fips does not have the same arch as the target program.  Calling dlopen from
 * a 64-bit fips would obtain an incompatible library for a 32-bit target
 * application.  This program is compiled in 32 and 64 bit variants, and fips
 * calls the right one based on the arch of the target program.
 *
 * Using a program like this allows us to directly inspect what the
 * dynamic loader actually does. This is much more reliable than
 * trying to recreate its search-path logic which would requrie at
 * least:
 *
 *	* Parsing LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 *
 *	* Correctly interpreting $LIB within LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 *
 *	* Knowing the canonical name for the current architecture for
 *        *$LIB
 *
 *	* Parsing /etc/ld.so.conf entries
 *
 *	* etc. etc.
