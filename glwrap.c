/* The prototypes for some OpenGL functions changed at one point from:
 *
 *	const void* *indices
 * to:
 *	const void* const coist *indices
 *
 * This makes it difficult for us to provide an implementation of
 * these functions that is consistent with the locally-available gl.h
 * since we don't know if the extra const will be present or not.
 *
 * To workaround this problem, we simply #define away const altogether
 * before including gl.h.
 *
 * Kudos to Keith Packard for suggesting this kludge.
