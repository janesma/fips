This directory was adapted from the glaze project at
http://git.cworth.org/git/glaze.  It contains .def files listing all
of the OpenGL functions for which fips creates ifunc resolvers so that
target applications can link against the fips libGL.

The .def files are automatically generated from XML descriptions of
the OpenGL API. The XML descriptions are included here as well, and
were obtained by starting from the Khronos "OpenGL Registry" at:

	http://www.opengl.org/registry/

From there, browse to the "XML API Registry" to find:

	https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/ogl/trunk/doc/registry/public/api/

Where the actual .xml files can be downloaded.

The XML files are made available under the same license as fips
itself, so are included in this directory.

The XML files contain much more information than fips needs. Fips
requires only the list of function names. We have written a one-liner
script named xml2def that extracts the function names. That script is
also included here.

The xml2def script depends on the XMLStarlet command-line XML toolkit
which is aailable as a Debian package named "xmlstarlet" or available
for download from:

	http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/

The simple .def files are the true "source" file used by fips, so
even though they were generated from an XML document, the generated
files are tracked under revision control here in this directory.

This means that a user of fips does not need to have xmlstarlet
installed in order to compile fips.
